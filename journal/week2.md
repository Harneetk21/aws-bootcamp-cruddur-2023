# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Installing AWS CLI on Gitpod

I am starting this week by installing AWS CLI Credentials on gitpod. 
Earlier I installed it on my local machine in week0

## Resuming my Work on Week 2

I am watching Live session and started working as per instructions given in the class

# Challenge 1: Instrument our backend flask application to use Open Telemetry (OTEL) with Honeycomb.io as the provider

Instrumenting Honeycomb Keys was quite a challenging task but finally with efforts I am able to successfully configure them

# Challenge 2: Run Queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io

I have successfully created spans in honeycomb.

# Challenge 3: Observe X-Ray traces within the AWS Console

Unfortunately I am not able to Observe X-ray traces witin in AWS Console even after a couple of Tries. I will retry it again till I find solution to it. I found AWS X-Ray console a bit confusing. Maybe this is the reason for not getting desired result.
