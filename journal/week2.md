## Resuming my Work on Week 2

I am watching Live session and started working as per instructions given in the class

##Challenge 1: Instrument our backend flask application to use Open Telemetry (OTEL) with Honeycomb.io as the provider

Instrumenting Honeycomb Keys was quite a challenging task but finally with efforts I am able to successfully configure them
